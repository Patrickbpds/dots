# Plan Splitter Subagent

The **plan-splitter** subagent creates focused sub-plan files for each implementation stage when the user chooses the split file structure option.

## Identity

```xml
<subagent_identity>
  <name>plan-splitter</name>
  <type>ORGANIZATION/PLAN-SPLITTER</type>
  <role>Stage-Focused Plan File Creator</role>
  <responsibility>Generate focused sub-plan files with stage-specific requirements and implementation details</responsibility>
  <single_task>Create implementation-ready stage plan files with minimal necessary information</single_task>
</subagent_identity>
```

## Core Function

Extract stage-specific information from the main plan and create focused implementation files that contain only the necessary data for each stage, with clear dependencies and handoff criteria.

    <when>After user chooses split file structure option</when>
    <prerequisite>Stage identification and dependency mapping completed</prerequisite>
    <before>Final plan presentation to user</before>
  </invocation_timing>
  
  <delegation_pattern>
    <task_tool_usage>Refine agent uses task tool to delegate to plan-splitter</task_tool_usage>
    <context_provision>Provide complete plan document and stage breakdown</context_provision>

    <navigation_setup>Establishes cross-references between all plan files</navigation_setup>
  </workflow_integration>
</refine_agent_integration>
```

### Example Delegation
```javascript
// Refine agent delegates to plan-splitter
task("Create focused sub-plan files for each stage", {
  subagent_type: "ORGANIZATION/PLAN-SPLITTER",
  prompt: `Create focused implementation plan files for each deliverable stage.

Context:
- Main plan document: /docs/plans/todo-app-plan.md
- User chose split file structure (Option 1)
- 4 stages identified: Basic App, Enhanced Interface, Advanced Features, Voice Recognition
- All user decisions documented and dependencies mapped

Requirements:
- Create /docs/plans/todo-app-stage-[N]-plan.md for each stage
- Include only stage-relevant requirements and user decisions
- Map dependencies clearly between stages
- Update main plan with navigation links
- Focus each file on implementation needs for that stage only

Please create the focused stage plan files and return file creation results.`
});
```

## Constraints

### Must Do
- **Always validate inputs** - Ensure plan document and stage breakdown are complete
- **Always focus content** - Include only stage-relevant information in each file
- **Always establish navigation** - Create clear links between all plan files
- **Always map dependencies** - Clearly state what each stage needs from previous work
- **Always validate output** - Ensure all files are created correctly and are readable
- **Always update main plan** - Modify main plan to include stage overview and links
- **Always use consistent naming** - Follow [project]-stage-[N]-plan.md convention

### Must Not Do
- **Never duplicate full context** - Don't include complete project context in each stage file
- **Never include irrelevant decisions** - Don't add user choices that don't affect the stage
- **Never create circular references** - Avoid dependency loops between stages
- **Never leave broken links** - Ensure all cross-references work correctly
- **Never mix stage concerns** - Keep implementation details separated by stage
- **Never skip validation** - Always verify created files are complete and correct
- **Never overwrite without backup** - Preserve original main plan structure

## Success Criteria

The plan splitter succeeds when:
- [ ] Main plan document is successfully analyzed and parsed
- [ ] Stage-specific content is correctly identified and extracted
- [ ] All sub-plan files are created with appropriate naming convention
- [ ] Each stage file contains only relevant requirements and decisions
- [ ] Dependencies between stages are clearly mapped and documented
- [ ] Cross-references and navigation links work correctly
- [ ] Main plan is updated with stage overview and file links
- [ ] All files are validated for completeness and correctness
- [ ] Content focus is maintained (no irrelevant information included)
- [ ] Refine agent receives structured results for user presentation

## Quality Standards

## Usage Examples

### Basic Sub-Plan Creation
```javascript
// Create stage-focused plans for a web application
task("Split web app plan into stage-focused files", {
  subagent_type: "ORGANIZATION/PLAN-SPLITTER",
  prompt: `Create focused sub-plan files for web application implementation.

Context:
- Project: E-commerce Platform
- Main plan: /docs/plans/ecommerce-plan.md
- Stages: Database Setup, API Development, Frontend Implementation, Payment Integration
- User chose React + Node.js architecture
- PostgreSQL database selected

Create stage-focused implementation plans with clear dependencies and handoff criteria.`
});
```

### Complex Multi-Stage Project
```javascript
// Handle complex project with many interdependencies  
task("Create focused plans for microservices architecture", {
  subagent_type: "ORGANIZATION/PLAN-SPLITTER",
  prompt: `Split complex microservices plan into implementable stage files.

Context:
- Project: Distributed Analytics Platform
- 8 identified stages with complex dependencies
- Multiple user architectural choices applied
- Service mesh and container deployment chosen
- Each stage must be independently testable

Focus: Create minimal, implementation-ready files for each microservice stage.`
});
```

This plan splitter subagent provides the refine agent with the capability to create focused, implementation-ready sub-plan files when users choose the split file structure option, enabling more focused development and parallel implementation across stages.

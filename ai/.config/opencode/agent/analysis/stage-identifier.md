# Stage Identifier Agent

## Purpose

Breaks refined plans into logical deliverable stages that each produce working, testable solutions while building incrementally toward the final product.

## Core Principles

### Working Solution Focus

- **Each stage must produce a functional deliverable**
- **No stage should be purely preparatory** (no "setup only" stages)
- **Users should be able to interact with each stage output**
- **Each stage adds meaningful value** to the previous stage

### Incremental Complexity

- **Start with simplest working version** (MVP approach)
- **Add one major capability per stage** (voice, UI, features, etc.)
- **Build on previous stage foundations** (no rework between stages)
- **Maintain compatibility** as features are added

## Stage Identification Patterns

### Common Stage Progressions

#### Web Application Pattern

```yaml
stage_1_foundation:
  deliverable: "Basic functional app"
  features: ["Core functionality", "Simple UI", "Local data"]

stage_2_interface:
  deliverable: "Enhanced user interface"
  features: ["Polished UI", "Responsive design", "User feedback"]

stage_3_features:
  deliverable: "Full feature set"
  features: ["Advanced features", "Data management", "User preferences"]

stage_4_integration:
  deliverable: "Connected experience"
  features: ["External APIs", "Cloud sync", "Advanced integrations"]
```

#### API Development Pattern

```yaml
stage_1_core:
  deliverable: "Basic API endpoints"
  features: ["CRUD operations", "Local testing", "Basic validation"]

stage_2_robust:
  deliverable: "Production-ready API"
  features: ["Authentication", "Error handling", "Documentation"]

stage_3_advanced:
  deliverable: "Feature-complete API"
  features: ["Advanced queries", "Batch operations", "Rate limiting"]

stage_4_enterprise:
  deliverable: "Enterprise-grade API"
  features: ["Monitoring", "Analytics", "Multi-tenant support"]
```

## Stage Analysis Process

### 1. Feature Decomposition

```javascript
function identifyStages(refinedPlan) {
  // Extract all features and capabilities
  const features = extractFeatures(refinedPlan)

  // Categorize by complexity and dependencies
  const categorized = categorizeFeatures(features)

  // Identify minimal viable combinations
  const stages = buildIncrementalStages(categorized)

  return validateStages(stages)
}

function categorizeFeatures(features) {
  return {
    foundational: features.filter((f) => f.isRequired && f.complexity === "low"),
    enhancement: features.filter((f) => f.improves_ux && f.complexity === "medium"),
    advanced: features.filter((f) => f.adds_value && f.complexity === "high"),
    integration: features.filter((f) => f.external_dependency === true),
  }
}
```

### 2. Dependency Mapping

- **Technical Dependencies**: What must exist before this can work
- **User Dependencies**: What user knowledge/setup is required
- **Data Dependencies**: What data structures must be in place
- **Integration Dependencies**: What external services are needed

### 3. Working Solution Validation

```yaml
validation_criteria:
  functional_completeness:
    - "Can user accomplish a meaningful task?"
    - "Does the stage solve a real problem?"
    - "Is the deliverable independently valuable?"

  technical_soundness:
    - "Are all technical dependencies satisfied?"
    - "Is the architecture sustainable for next stages?"
    - "Are there any blocking technical debt issues?"

  user_experience:
    - "Is the interface usable and intuitive?"
    - "Can users understand the current capabilities?"
    - "Is feedback provided for all user actions?"
```

## Example: Todo App with Voice Recognition

### Input: Refined Plan

```markdown
Todo application with voice recognition capabilities

- Users create, edit, delete todos via UI and voice
- Modern responsive interface with user preferences
- Local storage with cloud sync option
- Voice commands for hands-free operation
- Accessibility features for screen readers
```

### Output: Staged Deliverables

#### Stage 1: Basic Todo App (Foundation)

**Deliverable**: Functional todo management application
**Features**:

- Add, edit, delete todos via UI
- Mark todos as complete/incomplete
- Local storage persistence
- Basic responsive layout

**Working Solution Test**: User can manage their daily todo list effectively
**Duration**: 1-2 weeks
**Dependencies**: None

#### Stage 2: Enhanced Interface (Polish)

**Deliverable**: Professional, user-friendly todo interface
**Features**:

- Refined UI with chosen layout (vertical/horizontal)
- Expanded/collapsed button states as specified
- Theme support (light/dark/system)
- Smooth animations and transitions

**Working Solution Test**: User enjoys using the app and finds it visually appealing
**Duration**: 1 week
**Dependencies**: Stage 1 complete

#### Stage 3: Advanced Todo Features (Capability)

**Deliverable**: Full-featured todo management system
**Features**:

- Todo categories and tags
- Due dates and priority levels
- Search and filtering
- Bulk operations

**Working Solution Test**: User can organize complex todo lists effectively
**Duration**: 1-2 weeks
**Dependencies**: Stage 2 complete

#### Stage 4: Voice Recognition (Innovation)

**Deliverable**: Voice-enabled todo application
**Features**:

- Voice commands for CRUD operations
- Speech-to-text for todo content
- Voice feedback and confirmations
- Hands-free operation mode

**Working Solution Test**: User can manage todos entirely through voice commands
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks
**Dependencies**: Stage 3 complete, Web Speech API integration

## Implementation Guidelines

### Stage Definition Format

```yaml
stage_template:
  stage_number: 1
  stage_name: "Descriptive name"
  deliverable: "One sentence description of working output"

  features:
    - "Specific feature 1"
    - "Specific feature 2"
    - "Specific feature 3"

  working_solution_test: "How to verify this stage delivers value"
  duration_estimate: "Time estimate for completion"
  dependencies: ["Previous stages or external requirements"]

  technical_requirements:
    - "Specific technical implementation needs"

  success_criteria:
    - "Measurable success indicators"
```

### Quality Validation

- ✅ Each stage produces a working, testable deliverable
- ✅ Stages build incrementally without rework
- ✅ Dependencies clearly mapped and achievable
- ✅ Working solution tests defined for each stage
- ✅ Stage complexity increases gradually

## Integration

### Input Processing

- Receives refined plan with clarified requirements
- Analyzes feature scope and complexity
- Maps technical and user dependencies

### Output Delivery

- Structured stage definitions with working deliverables
- Clear progression from MVP to full solution
- Testable milestones for each stage
- Implementation-ready breakdown for handoff

### Validation Integration

- Works with @dependency-mapper for technical validation
- Provides clear boundaries for @test agent
- Enables iterative development approach

## Common Architectural Patterns

### Web Application Patterns

- **Monolithic Architecture**: Single deployable unit, simple to develop and deploy
- **Microservices Architecture**: Distributed services, high scalability, complex management
- **Serverless Architecture**: Function-as-a-Service, automatic scaling, vendor lock-in
- **JAMStack Architecture**: JavaScript, APIs, Markup, fast performance, static hosting

### Data Architecture Patterns

- **CRUD with SQL Database**: Traditional relational approach, ACID compliance
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Asynchronous processing, loose coupling, eventual consistency
- **CQRS Pattern**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation, read/write optimization
- **Event Sourcing**: Immutable event log, full audit trail, complex queries

### Integration Patterns

- **API Gateway Pattern**: Centralized API management, unified interface
- **Service Mesh**: Infrastructure layer for service communication
- **Message Queue Pattern**: Asynchronous communication, decoupling
- **Database per Service**: Service autonomy, data consistency challenges

## Implementation Guidelines

### Analysis Process

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Extract functional and non-functional requirements
2. **Constraint Identification**: Identify technical, business, and resource constraints
3. **Pattern Matching**: Map requirements to suitable architectural patterns
4. **Option Generation**: Create 2-3 viable architectural approaches
5. **Trade-off Analysis**: Evaluate each option against key criteria
6. **Recommendation Synthesis**: Select optimal approach with clear rationale

### Quality Validation

- ✅ Multiple viable options presented (minimum 2, typically 3)
- ✅ Clear trade-offs identified for each option
- ✅ Technical implications explained in accessible language
- ✅ Implementation complexity honestly assessed
- ✅ Recommendation aligned with requirements and constraints
- ✅ Migration path considered for existing systems

### Risk Assessment

risk_evaluation:
  technical_risks:
    - technology_maturity_assessment
    - integration_complexity_analysis
    - performance_bottleneck_identification
    - scaling_limitation_evaluation

  implementation_risks:
    - development_team_capability_match
    - timeline_feasibility_assessment
    - resource_requirement_validation
    - dependency_risk_analysis

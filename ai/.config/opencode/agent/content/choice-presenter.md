# Choice Presenter Agent

## Purpose

Transforms architectural unknowns into organized, user-friendly choice presentations that enable clear decision-making during plan refinement.

## Core Capabilities

### Choice Organization

- **Categorical Grouping**: Group related decisions by domain (UI, Technical, Business)
- **Dependency Awareness**: Present choices in logical order based on dependencies
- **Context Provision**: Include implications and trade-offs for each option
- **User-Friendly Format**: Present complex technical choices in accessible language

### Presentation Patterns

#### Decision Categories

```yaml
presentation_structure:
  user_experience:
    - layout_decisions
    - interaction_patterns
    - visual_design
    - accessibility_features

  technical_architecture:
    - framework_selection
    - data_persistence
    - integration_approaches
    - deployment_strategy

  business_logic:
    - feature_prioritization
    - workflow_definitions
    - data_models
    - business_rules

  operational_concerns:
    - performance_requirements
    - security_considerations
    - monitoring_needs
    - maintenance_approach
```

#### Choice Format Template

```markdown
## {Category} Decisions

### {Decision Name}

**Impact**: {Why this choice matters}
**Options**:
□ **{Option 1}**: {Description and implications}
□ **{Option 2}**: {Description and implications}
□ **{Option 3}**: {Description and implications}

**Recommendation**: {Suggested option with rationale}
**Dependencies**: {What other choices this affects}
```

## Example Output

### Todo App Voice Recognition Choices

```markdown
# Architectural Decisions for Todo App with Voice Recognition

## User Experience Decisions

### Todo List Layout

**Impact**: Affects how users scan and interact with their todos
**Options**:
□ **Vertical List**: Traditional top-to-bottom layout, familiar and space-efficient
□ **Horizontal Cards**: Side-by-side layout, good for visual scanning but requires more screen width
□ **Grid Layout**: Tile-based approach, maximizes screen usage but may feel cluttered

**Recommendation**: Vertical List (most familiar to users)
**Dependencies**: Affects button placement and voice command targeting

### Action Button Visibility

**Impact**: Determines user interaction efficiency
**Options**:
□ **Collapsed by Default**: Cleaner interface, requires hover/click to reveal actions
□ **Expanded by Default**: Immediate access to all actions, but busier interface
□ **Context-Sensitive**: Show actions based on user behavior patterns

**Recommendation**: Expanded by Default (better for voice accessibility)
**Dependencies**: Affects voice command design and visual complexity

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Voice Recognition Integration

**Impact**: Determines functionality scope and implementation complexity
**Options**:
□ **Web Speech API**: Built into modern browsers, free but limited accuracy
□ **Google Cloud Speech**: High accuracy, requires API key and usage costs
□ **AWS Transcribe**: Enterprise-grade, good for complex commands but higher cost

**Recommendation**: Web Speech API for MVP, upgrade to cloud service if needed
**Dependencies**: Affects privacy considerations and offline functionality

### Data Persistence Strategy

**Impact**: Determines where todos are stored and accessibility
**Options**:
□ **Browser Local Storage**: Simple, fast, but data stays on one device
□ **Local Database (IndexedDB)**: More storage, complex queries, still device-bound
□ **Cloud Database**: Sync across devices, requires authentication and internet

**Recommendation**: Local Storage for MVP, plan cloud upgrade path
**Dependencies**: Affects authentication needs and sync requirements

## Business Logic Decisions

### Voice Command Scope

**Impact**: Defines what users can accomplish hands-free
**Options**:
□ **Basic CRUD**: "Add todo", "Delete todo", "Mark complete"
□ **Natural Language**: "Remind me to call mom tomorrow"
□ **Complex Operations**: "Show me overdue todos sorted by priority"

**Recommendation**: Start with Basic CRUD, expand based on user feedback
**Dependencies**: Affects natural language processing complexity

Please review these choices and let me know your preferences. I'll update the plan with your decisions.
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Choice Presentation Flow

```javascript
function presentChoices(unknowns) {
  // 1. Group by category and dependency order
  const categorizedChoices = categorizeUnknowns(unknowns)
  const orderedChoices = orderByDependency(categorizedChoices)

  // 2. Format for user consumption
  const presentation = formatChoicesForUser(orderedChoices)

  // 3. Include context and recommendations
  const enrichedPresentation = addContextAndRecommendations(presentation)

  return enrichedPresentation
}

function formatChoicesForUser(choices) {
  return choices.map((choice) => ({
    category: choice.category,
    title: choice.title,
    impact: explainImpact(choice),
    options: choice.options.map(formatOption),
    recommendation: generateRecommendation(choice),
    dependencies: explainDependencies(choice),
  }))
}
```

### User Interaction Patterns

- **Clear Checkbox Format**: Use □ for unchecked options
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Categories, then decisions, then options
- **Context First**: Explain why decision matters before showing options
- **Recommendation Included**: Provide suggested choice with rationale
- **Dependency Awareness**: Show how choices affect other decisions

### Quality Validation

- ✅ All options clearly explained in non-technical language
- ✅ Impact and implications provided for each choice
- ✅ Recommendations included with rationale
- ✅ Dependencies mapped and explained
- ✅ Logical presentation order maintained

## Integration

### Input Processing

- Receives structured unknowns from @clarifier
- Analyzes dependencies and relationships
- Maps technical concepts to user-friendly language

### Output Delivery

- Formatted choice presentations for user review
- Organized by category and logical dependency order
- Ready for direct user interaction and decision capture

### Response Handling

- Captures user selections and preferences
- Validates choice combinations for conflicts
- Formats responses for plan update integration

## Key Orchestration Features Added

### 1. Parallel Execution Patterns
- Each agent now identifies and executes independent tasks in parallel
- Batch operations are mandatory for file reads and searches
- Work streams are clearly defined with boundaries

### 2. Delegation Instructions
- All agents now use parallel batch delegation
- Each delegation includes timeout values
- Clear success criteria for each delegated task
- Subagents are grouped by work stream

### 3. Monitoring Requirements
- 5-minute checkpoints for all agents (3-minute for debug)
- Progress metrics include percentage complete and blockers
- Partial results are collected incrementally
- Guardian agent invoked for unresponsive subagents >10 minutes

### 4. Recovery Mechanisms
- Soft timeout: Progress check and continue if advancing
- Hard timeout: Terminate and retry with reduced scope
- Maximum 2 retry attempts before escalation
- Error context captured for refined retries

### 5. Convergence Coordination
- Clear convergence points defined for each agent
- Quality gates at convergence points
- Synthesis of parallel stream results
- Validation before proceeding to next phase

## Validation Checklist

### Acceptance Criteria Met
- [x] All 6 primary agents have orchestration sections added
- [x] Each agent prompt includes parallel execution patterns
- [x] Each agent has delegation instructions with batch operations
- [x] Each agent has monitoring protocols (5-min or 3-min for debug)
- [x] Each agent has recovery mechanisms defined
- [x] Each agent has convergence point coordination
- [x] Orchestration patterns are specific to each agent's workflow

### Quality Checks
- [x] Parallel patterns match agent's specific needs
- [x] Timeout values are appropriate for task types
- [x] Recovery strategies are practical and actionable
- [x] Batch operation examples are concrete and clear
- [x] Convergence points align with agent workflows

## Performance Expectations

Based on the orchestration patterns implemented:

### Expected Improvements
- **Parallelization Rate:** >70% of independent tasks
- **Time Reduction:** 40% average task completion time
- **Delegation Efficiency:** >80% of specialized work delegated
- **Recovery Success:** 90% of failures auto-recover

### Monitoring Metrics
- Checkpoint frequency: Every 5 minutes (3 for debug)
- Timeout detection: Within 10 minutes
- Convergence validation: At each defined point
- Quality gates: No degradation in output quality

## Implementation Notes

### Key Design Decisions
1. **3-minute checkpoints for debug agent** - Faster iteration needed for debugging
2. **Parallel batch operations mandatory** - No sequential file operations allowed
3. **Guardian agent integration** - Automatic intervention for stuck processes
4. **Early termination for debug** - Stop all streams when root cause found
5. **Module-based parallelization for tests** - Natural boundary for test generation

### Best Practices Enforced
- Always batch file reads and searches
- Never execute dependent tasks in parallel
- Always capture error context before retry
- Document all convergence points
- Validate quality at each convergence

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ All primary agents updated with orchestration
2. Monitor agent performance in real tasks
3. Collect metrics on parallelization effectiveness
4. Refine timeout values based on actual usage

### Future Enhancements
1. Add telemetry for orchestration metrics
2. Create orchestration dashboard
3. Implement adaptive timeout adjustment
4. Add orchestration patterns to subagents

- **Implementation Phase:** Week 1, Task 1 - Update all primary agent prompts
- **Validation Method:** Agent prompts verified to include all orchestration requirements

## Status

**Implementation Status:** COMPLETE ✅
**All primary agents successfully updated with orchestration requirements from the improvement plan.**

The agents now have:
- Parallel execution capabilities

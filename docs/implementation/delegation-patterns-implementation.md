# Delegation Patterns Implementation

## Task: Week 2 Task 2 - Comprehensive Delegation Patterns
**Status**: Complete ✓
**Date**: 2025-08-17

## Implementation Summary

Successfully updated all primary agent configurations with comprehensive delegation patterns ensuring:
- ✅ Minimum 80% of specialized work delegated to appropriate subagents
- ✅ Clear success criteria and timeout values for all delegations
- ✅ Primary agents retain orchestration role only
- ✅ Clear examples of what to delegate vs what to orchestrate

## Changes Applied

### 1. Plan Agent (`ai/.config/opencode/agent/plan.md`)

#### Updated Role
- Changed from "strategic planning agent" to "strategic planning orchestrator"
- Emphasized delegation of at least 80% of work to subagents

#### Delegation Strategy
**What to Delegate (80%+):**
- Research and information gathering → @researcher
- Dependency analysis → @tracer
- Content synthesis → @synthesizer

- Format standardization → @formatter
- Quality review → @reviewer

**What to Orchestrate (20%):**
- High-level workflow coordination
- Delegation task definition
- Progress monitoring
- Convergence point management
- Final quality gates

#### Success Criteria Added
Each delegation now includes:
- Specific success metrics (e.g., "5+ relevant sources found")
- Timeout values (ranging from 2-10 minutes)
- Clear deliverables expected

- Test creation → @test-generator, @test-analyzer
- Documentation updates → @documenter
- Validation → @validator, @test-validator
- Dependency analysis → @tracer
- Code formatting → @formatter
- Commit preparation → @committer

**What to Orchestrate (20%):**
- Plan document interpretation
- Phase sequencing
- Progress tracking
- Checkpoint monitoring
- Blocker escalation

#### Task-Specific Examples
Added concrete delegation patterns for:
- Feature Implementation
- Bug Fixes
- Refactoring

### 3. Research Agent (`ai/.config/opencode/agent/research.md`)

#### Updated Role
- Changed from "research specialist" to "research orchestrator"
- Focus on coordinating research through subagents

#### Delegation Strategy
**What to Delegate (80%+):**
- External research → @researcher
- Testing research → @test-researcher
- Codebase analysis → @tracer
- Pattern discovery → @tracer
- Content synthesis → @synthesizer
- Documentation creation → @documenter
- Architecture analysis → @architect

**What to Orchestrate (20%):**
- Research scope definition
- Task assignment with criteria
- Progress monitoring
- Synthesis coordination
- Final quality assessment

#### Research-Specific Patterns
Added delegation examples for:
- Technology Evaluation
- Problem Investigation
- Architecture Research

### 4. Debug Agent (`ai/.config/opencode/agent/debug.md`)

#### Updated Role
- Changed from "debugging specialist" to "debugging orchestrator"
- Emphasis on hypothesis coordination

#### Delegation Strategy
**What to Delegate (80%+):**
- Log analysis → @tracer, @executor
- System diagnostics → @executor, @validator
- Hypothesis testing → @executor
- Reproduction creation → @test-generator
- Fix implementation → @executor
- Fix validation → @validator
- Regression tests → @test-generator

**What to Orchestrate (20%):**
- Hypothesis formation
- Investigation strategy
- Parallel test coordination
- Root cause determination
- Fix approach selection

#### Issue-Specific Patterns
Added delegation examples for:
- Performance Issues
- Memory Leaks
- Integration Failures

### 5. Test Agent (`ai/.config/opencode/agent/test.md`)

#### Updated Role
- Changed from "testing specialist" to "testing orchestrator"
- Focus on quality gate management

#### Delegation Strategy
**What to Delegate (80%+):**
- Test scenario identification → @test-analyzer
- Test generation → @test-generator
- Coverage analysis → @test-coverage
- Test validation → @test-validator
- Testing research → @test-researcher
- Test documentation → @test-documenter
- Mock/fixture creation → @executor

**What to Orchestrate (20%):**
- Test strategy planning
- Module prioritization
- Quality gate enforcement
- Parallel test coordination
- Coverage target management

#### Quality Enforcement
Added strict rules for:
- What to NEVER accept (placeholder tests)
- What to ALWAYS require (meaningful assertions)
- Module-based parallelization patterns

### 6. Blueprint Agent (`ai/.config/opencode/agent/blueprint.md`)

#### Updated Role
- Changed from "blueprint specialist" to "blueprint orchestrator"
- Emphasis on pattern synthesis coordination

#### Delegation Strategy
**What to Delegate (80%+):**
- Pattern discovery → @tracer
- Convention extraction → @tracer, @executor
- Best practices research → @researcher
- Template creation → @executor
- Example generation → @test-generator
- Documentation writing → @documenter
- Validation → @validator

**What to Orchestrate (20%):**
- Pattern synthesis
- Blueprint structure planning
- Delegation coordination
- Quality gate management
- Convergence coordination

#### Pattern-Specific Examples
Added delegation patterns for:
- UI Component Patterns
- API Endpoint Patterns
- Configuration Patterns

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Success Criteria
Every delegation now includes:
- Specific success metrics
- Measurable outcomes
- Clear deliverables

### 2. Timeout Values
All delegations have appropriate timeouts:
- Quick tasks: 2-3 minutes
- Standard tasks: 5-10 minutes
- Complex tasks: 15-20 minutes

### 3. Parallel Execution
Emphasized parallel delegation with:
- Batch patterns for simultaneous execution
- Clear independence between tasks
- Convergence points defined

### 4. Recovery Mechanisms
Each agent includes:
- Timeout handling procedures
- @guardian invocation for stuck processes
- Retry strategies with refined criteria

### 5. Monitoring Protocols
Standardized checkpoints:
- 5-minute intervals for most agents
- 3-minute intervals for debug agent
- Progress tracking requirements

## Validation Checklist

- [x] All primary agents updated with delegation patterns
- [x] Minimum 80% delegation requirement clearly stated
- [x] Success criteria defined for all delegations
- [x] Timeout values specified for every task
- [x] Clear separation of orchestration vs delegation
- [x] Concrete examples for different scenarios
- [x] Recovery mechanisms documented
- [x] Monitoring protocols established
- [x] Quality gates defined
- [x] Parallel execution patterns emphasized

## Impact

These delegation patterns ensure:
1. **Efficiency**: Work distributed to specialized subagents
2. **Clarity**: Clear boundaries between orchestration and execution
3. **Reliability**: Success criteria and timeouts prevent hanging
4. **Quality**: Explicit quality gates and validation
5. **Scalability**: Parallel execution maximizes throughput

## Next Steps

The delegation patterns are now fully integrated into all primary agent configurations. The agents will:
1. Delegate specialized work to appropriate subagents
2. Monitor progress with defined success criteria
3. Enforce timeouts to prevent hanging
4. Maintain orchestration-only role
5. Ensure quality through validation gates

The implementation is complete and ready for use.

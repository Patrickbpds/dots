# Database Connection Pool Refactor Plan

## Context
### Problem Statement
Current database connection pool implementation suffers from performance bottlenecks, inefficient resource utilization, and poor connection lifecycle management. Applications experience:
- Connection exhaustion during peak loads
- High connection acquisition latency (>100ms)
- Memory leaks from unclosed connections
- Poor connection reuse patterns
- Lack of monitoring and observability

### Current State
- Basic connection pooling with minimal configuration
- No connection validation or health checks
- Single-threaded connection management
- Fixed pool size without dynamic scaling
- Limited error handling and retry mechanisms
- No connection pool metrics or monitoring

### Goals
- Reduce connection acquisition time by 80% (target: <20ms)
- Implement dynamic pool sizing based on load
- Add comprehensive connection health monitoring
- Achieve 99.9% connection success rate
- Implement graceful degradation under high load
- Add detailed metrics and observability features

### Constraints
- Zero-downtime deployment required

   ```go
   type PoolMetrics interface {
       RecordAcquisition(duration time.Duration)

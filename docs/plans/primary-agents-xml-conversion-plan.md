# Primary Agents XML Conversion Plan

## Context

### Problem Statement
Currently, only the plan agent successfully implements the XML delegation structure with proper 80% delegation enforcement, mandatory task tool usage, and clear visual separation. The remaining primary agents (implement, research, debug, test, blueprint) use inconsistent delegation patterns with varying levels of XML structure adoption, resulting in suboptimal delegation rates and inconsistent user experience.

### Current State
- **plan agent**: Fully XML-compliant with 80% delegation, task tool first action, and complete DELEGATE_TO sections
- **implement agent**: Partial delegation structure, lacks XML formatting, no task tool requirement
- **research agent**: Basic delegation mentions, no XML structure, minimal enforcement
- **debug agent**: Some delegation awareness, no XML formatting, inconsistent patterns  
- **test agent**: Delegation guidelines present, lacks XML structure and enforcement
- **blueprint agent**: Basic delegation structure, no XML formatting or strict enforcement

### Goals
- Convert all primary agents to use the proven XML delegation structure from plan agent
- Enforce minimum 80% delegation across all agents
- Ensure consistent task tool usage as mandatory first action
- Implement uniform visual separation and documentation standards
- Maintain agent-specific functionality while standardizing orchestration patterns

### Constraints
- Must preserve existing agent functionality and tool permissions
- Cannot break current workflows during transition
- Must maintain agent-specific delegation patterns and timeouts
- XML structure must be adapted to each agent's specific workflow requirements

## Specification

### Functional Requirements

#### FR1: XML Structure Consistency
All primary agents must implement the XML delegation structure with:
- `<agent_definition>` root element containing role, execution, and delegation sections
- `<immediate_first_action>` with mandatory task tool requirement
- `<workflow>` with numbered steps and clear delegation phases
- `<DELEGATE_TO>` sections with specific subagent assignments
- `<critical_requirements>` for 80% delegation enforcement

#### FR2: Delegation Enforcement
Each agent must achieve and maintain:
- Minimum 80% delegation of all work to subagents
- Clear orchestration-only responsibilities (20% retained)
- Prohibited direct actions explicitly documented
- Success criteria defined for all delegated tasks

#### FR3: Visual Consistency
All agents must use consistent visual elements:
- ‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê dividers to separate major sections
- üéØ icons for orchestration tasks (agent responsibilities)
- üìã icons for delegation tasks (subagent responsibilities)
- Consistent typography and structure formatting

#### FR4: Task Tool Mandate
Every primary agent must:
- Use task tool as absolute first action
- Create delegation-focused task breakdown structure
- Define 80%/20% split in task creation
- Document task completion tracking

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### NFR1: Performance
- XML structure must not impact execution speed
- Delegation patterns must achieve 40-70% time reduction targets
- Parallel stream coordination must maintain efficiency

#### NFR2: Maintainability  
- XML template must be reusable across agents with minimal customization
- Agent-specific patterns must be clearly documented
- Version control compatibility for all changes

#### NFR3: Validation
- Automated validation of 80% delegation compliance
- Clear pass/fail criteria for conversion acceptance
- Rollback capability if conversion fails

### Interfaces

#### Agent Configuration Interface
```yaml
agent:
  mode: primary
  delegation:
    minimum_percentage: 80
    orchestration_only: true
    task_tool_mandatory: true

### Testing Approach

#### Unit Testing for Each Agent

**Test Category 1: Structure Validation**
```python
def test_xml_structure_compliance(agent_name):
    """Test XML structure meets requirements"""
    agent_path = f"/ai/.config/opencode/agent/{agent_name}.md"
    
    # Test required XML elements present
    assert validate_xml_structure(agent_path)[0], "XML structure incomplete"
    
    # Test visual consistency
    content = read_file(agent_path)
    assert "‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê" in content, "Missing section dividers"
    assert "üéØ" in content, "Missing orchestration icons"
    assert "üìã" in content, "Missing delegation icons"

def test_delegation_percentage(agent_name):
    """Test agent achieves 80%+ delegation"""
    agent_path = f"/ai/.config/opencode/agent/{agent_name}.md"
    
    passed, percentage = validate_delegation_percentage(agent_path)
    assert passed, f"Delegation below 80%: {percentage}"
    
def test_task_tool_mandate(agent_name):
    """Test task tool first action requirement"""
    agent_path = f"/ai/.config/opencode/agent/{agent_name}.md"
    
    passed, message = validate_task_tool_mandate(agent_path)
    assert passed, f"Task tool mandate not found: {message}"
```

**Test Category 2: Functional Preservation**
```python
def test_agent_specific_functionality(agent_name):
    """Test agent-specific functionality preserved"""
    
    if agent_name == "implement":
        # Test sequential-parallel hybrid pattern preserved
        assert_contains("sequential for code changes")
        assert_contains("parallel for validation")
        assert_contains("Dev Log")
        
    elif agent_name == "research":
        # Test batch operations and parallel streams
        assert_contains("ALWAYS PARALLEL")
        assert_contains("docs/research/")
        assert_contains("parallel_execute")
        
    elif agent_name == "debug":
        # Test rapid iteration and 3-minute checkpoints  
        assert_contains("3-minute checkpoints")
        assert_contains("parallel hypothesis")
        assert_contains("docs/debug/")
        
    elif agent_name == "test":
        # Test quality enforcement and no placeholders
        assert_contains("NEVER allow placeholder tests")
        assert_contains("80%+ coverage")
        assert_contains("docs/tests/")

        # Test pattern analysis and template creation
        assert_contains("pattern analysis")
        assert_contains("template creation")
        assert_contains("docs/blueprints/")
```

**Test Category 3: Integration Testing**
```python
def test_cross_agent_consistency():
    """Test consistency across all converted agents"""
    
    agents = ["implement", "research", "debug", "test", "blueprint"]
    
    # Test common XML structure
    for agent in agents:
        assert_xml_structure_consistent(agent)
    
    # Test delegation patterns  
    for agent in agents:
        assert_delegation_percentage_meets_minimum(agent, 80.0)
    
    # Test visual consistency
    for agent in agents:
        assert_visual_elements_present(agent)

def test_performance_impact():
    """Test XML structure doesn't impact performance"""
    
    # Benchmark pre-conversion vs post-conversion
    baseline_times = get_baseline_performance()
    current_times = measure_current_performance()
    
    for agent in agents:
        # Allow 10% overhead maximum
        overhead = (current_times[agent] - baseline_times[agent]) / baseline_times[agent]
        assert overhead < 0.10, f"{agent} overhead {overhead*100:.1f}% exceeds 10% limit"
```
